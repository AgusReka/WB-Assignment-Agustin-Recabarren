          <h1>​​The Benefits of Working with a Luxury Presence Agent</h1>
          <h2>
            Why you should hire an agent who has partnered with a luxury real
            estate marketing company.

            One of the biggest perks of working with a real estate agent is
            their ability to market your property to the right target audience.
            A professional agent with the right experience will be able to
            identify who will be interested in your property and implement
            effective strategies to reach them via their website, paid
            advertising, social media, and other means. When you work with an
            agent who has partnered with Luxury Presence, you benefit from the
            many different types of marketing capabilities the company offers.
            Here is how:

        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <p>
            To reach your potential buyers, you have to know who they are, where
            they spend their time online, and how they make their buying
            decisions. Agents who use luxury real estate marketing services are
            able to identify your niche market, then create paid ads on
            Facebook, Google, Instagram, and YouTube that reach those interested
            in your property. These paid ad campaigns are highly customized and
            targeted, ensuring you are not spending money marketing to those who
            are not in the market for a property such as yours.

            Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent
            has to promote your property. Being able to create high-quality
            content such as video and copywriting is an essential tool that
            elevates the agents who use luxury real estate marketing services
            above their competitors. According to a recent survey,
            <a
              href="https://www.nateisaacs.com/why-real-estate-agents-should-use-video-in-their-marketing/"
              target="_blank"
              >85 percent of buyers and sellers want to work with an agent who
              uses video</a
            >
            —and for good reason. An agent who uses video is able to connect
            with potential buyers on a deeper level and build trust and rapport.
            When they use video to market your property, they are showing
            viewers what it would really be like to walk through and live in
            your home—something that is much more difficult to do with a written
            description. However, written descriptions—or copywriting—is also
            important. Your property needs to be described in appealing and
            vibrant terms on the listing and on any additional marketing that is
            created to sell it. Those agents who work with Luxury Presence get
            access to experienced real estate copywriters who create blogs,
            website copy, and content marketing pieces that make your property
            attractive to potential buyers.

          <h1>Effective Search Engine Optimization</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <p>
            Recent research has shown that
            <a
              href="https://www.nar.realtor/infographics/where-buyers-found-the-home-they-purchased"
              target="_blank"
              >44% of buyers found the home they purchased</a
            >
            &nbsp; on the internet. Many of them simply googled the search terms
            that they wanted in a new home and started their search that way.
            For your home to show up in these types of searches, your real
            estate agent needs to use the right terms in your online marketing.
            The effective use of these terms is referred to as search engine
            optimization or SEO. The process of identifying and correctly using
            the right terms is a bit of a science—one that the SEO experts at
            Luxury Presence have mastered. When a potential buyer searches terms
            that match your home, your property will show up in the results and
            provide opportunities for the buyer to learn more.

          <p>
            If your real estate agent is an influencer on social media, he or
            she has access to thousands of niche buyers who are ready to invest
            in property. To be an influencer, an agent either needs to dedicate
            a large chunk of their time to social media or they need to partner
            with luxury real estate marketing service providers who can put in
            the work for them. Wouldn’t you rather your agent spent his or her
            time marketing your property and let an expert handle their social
            media presence? At Luxury Presence, our dedicated success team
            utilizes an agent’s stories and feed posts to help them go viral and
            become an authority in their industry. Once they’ve harnessed the
            power of becoming an influencer, they can use their voice to
            advocate for your home and sell it more quickly than their
            competitors.
